## MACHINE LEARNING

## INTRODUCTION
> We from Latorians Group have discussed bringing The Cervical Cancer issue as our main
> issue parallel with the theme of the project is `HEALTHCARE HACKS`.
> In this project we want to explore and analyze `The Cervical Cancer` as our specific domain by using machine learning. Our goal is to develop machine learning that can help society scale their health level and calculate the possibility that they will be affected by cervical cancer.
